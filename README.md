# Face Detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier

This is a simple real-time face detection project built using **Python** and **OpenCV**, utilizing a pre-trained **Haar Cascade Classifier**. The application captures webcam input and detects faces in real-time.

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Haar Cascade Classifier (from OpenCV library)

---

## Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Draws green bounding boxes around detected faces
- Uses grayscale conversion and Haar features
- Press **Q** to quit the webcam feed
